## Build Process 

The initial plan for this project was to update my profile website and use every skill that i had learnt previously. The original plan was as follows:

1. Update everything using Tailwind
2. Implement handlebars and use a database to fill in all the cards
3. Make a contact page that uses some form of authentication 
4. Add a message board for people to push a message to the database

## Project Issues

Core problems like usual was I bit off more than I could chew. Its really easy to overestimate how much time I spend on my CSS and just concepts. Once everything on the main page was working I put started working on the database and thats where the issues began. The issue were as follows.

1. I really didn't need a database. I just wanted to see if I could make one on the fly
2. In the end I had to remove the database components and use netlify
3. I wasted a lot of time on the backend of the website which was not needed
4. Lots of small CSS issues which needed to be fixed especially in regards to mobile
5. Took way too much time again

That stated I really starting to get a stronger sense of how to use flex box and trying my best to move away from things like absolute positioning. Very happy with the outcome.
